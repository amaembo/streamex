# Migration between StreamEx releases

This document describes StreamEx changes which may break the backwards compatibility. For full list of changes see [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md).

### 0.9.0
Issue#282: JSpecify nullity annotations were added. This may break the source compatibility if the library was used from Kotlin code with incompatible types.
Also, this may issue new static analyzer warnings. For example, it may cause build failure if NullAway is used as a part of the build pipeline.

Issue#283: Redundant type arguments were removed from single-argument `IntStreamEx.ofIndices` overloads. This may cause warnings or errors if they were explicitly specified.
To fix this, just remove them from the code.

### 0.8.0
Issue#244: To align with Java 16 `Stream.toList` specification, we no more guarantee that the results of 
`AbstractStreamEx.toList` and `AbstractStreamEx.toSet` are mutable. They are still mutable by default 
but this will change in future release. You can switch their implementation to immutable, using temporary 
system property `-Dstreamex.default.immutable=true` and test how your code behaves. If you actually need mutability, 
use new methods `AbstractStreamEx.toMutableList` and `AbstractStreamEx.toMutableSet`.

### 0.7.3
Issue#219: Now many collectors defined in `MoreCollectors` may throw NullPointerException more eagerly, before the
 collector is used. Also, `MoreCollectors.last` now throws NullPointerException if the last element is null (this
  makes it conformant to `MoreCollectors.first`).

### 0.7.0
Issue#194: Method `skipOrdered` is removed, which may break source and binary compatibility if in was used. Use simply `skip` instead.
PR#200: Overloads added to `EntryStream.allMatch/anyMatch/noneMatch` which accept a `BiPredicate`. Such overloads may cause
    source incompatibility in rare case when a method reference was used which is either bound to var-arg method or
    has several overloads. E.g. assuming `boolean allNull(Object... objects)` now `EntryStream.of(...).allMatch(Utils::allNull)`
    won't compile anymore. To work-around this issue use a lambda instead of method reference.

### 0.6.0

Issue#67: Now `StreamEx.withFirst()` as well as `StreamEx.withFirst(BinaryOperator)` include `(first, first)` pair. If you used these operations in StreamEx 0.5.3-0.5.5, you should update the existing code: replace `.withFirst()` with `.withFirst().skip(1)`.

### 0.5.5

Issue#41: As `StreamEx.without(T...)` was added, the existing code may become ambiguous now. If you've used `.without(null)` before, replace it with dedicated `.nonNull()` operation.

Issue#63: `DoubleStreamEx.reverseSorted()` may change the order of non-canonical `NaN` values (actually sorting them).

### 0.5.3

Issue#52: `StreamEx.append(T...)` and `prepend(T...)` are final now, so if you extend `StreamEx` class, you cannot override them anymore. 

### 0.5.0

Issue#8: The package `javax.util.streamex` is renamed to `one.util.streamex`. The OSGi bundle name and Maven groupId are changed correspondingly. To migrate to StreamEx 0.5.0 you should:

* Replace every occurrence of `javax.util.streamex` to `one.util.streamex` in your Java files and OSGi manifests.
* Replace `io.github.amaembo` groupID with `one.util` in your build files (pom.xml, ivy.xml, build.gradle, etc.)
